# breastcancerprediction_ML

Steps in the Project

Import Libraries

Use pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn for data handling & visualization.

Use sklearn for preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

Load & Explore Data

Import dataset with pandas.

Check shape, column names, missing values.

Visualize data distribution (e.g., count of malignant vs benign).

Data Preprocessing

Select features (X) and target (y).

Encode target labels (M = 1, B = 0).

Split dataset into train/test sets.

Standardize features with StandardScaler.

Model Building

Start with Logistic Regression as baseline.

Optionally try other models like Random Forest, SVM, etc.

Training & Evaluation

Train model using .fit().

Predict on test set.

Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report.

Results & Conclusion

Share accuracy score and insights.

Highlight importance: ML helps doctors by providing a second opinion, but not a replacement for medical diagnosis.
